### BikeShare Project
February 2025

### Description
This project analyzes US bikeshare data for three major cities: **Chicago**, **New York City**, and **Washington**. The Python script `bikeshare.py` uses user input to filter data by city, month, and day of the week, then displays statistics on travel times, popular stations, trip durations, and user demographics.

- **Data Files:**  
  The project uses CSV files (`chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv`, `washington.csv`) containing trip data. These files are ignored by Git (via `.gitignore`) to keep the repository lightweight.

- **Dependencies:**  
  - Python 3.x  
  - [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)  
  - [numpy](https://numpy.org/)
